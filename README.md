# My YouTube video making scripts

Here's a bunch of scripts, with which I let GPT-3.5 turbo in combination with LangChain
run wild with DuckDuckGo search, plan and text out its own YouTube scripts.
Those are then turned into actual videos using models like SadTalker, Bark, DALLE-3 as
well as PikaAI.

As some point, the goal is to simply make a video by typing "make video". haha
